## 🔍 Problem Statement

Job seekers often apply with **generic or misaligned resumes** that fail to match the job description (JD). Recruiters quickly discard these due to:

- Missing keywords and core skills
- Poor formatting or irrelevant experience
- ATS-unfriendly structure
- No personalization for the role

## 🎯 Our Solution

**Resume Screener AI** allows users to upload a resume and a job description. Then it uses **GPT-4 and Cohere** to:

✅ **Compare Resume vs Job Description**  
✅ **Score the match** (e.g., 76%)  
✅ **Highlight missing skills, tools, job titles**  
✅ **Suggest improvements**  
✅ **Rewrite the resume** in one click  
✅ **Check ATS compatibility**

All built with modern tech and clean UX, this MVP is ready to evolve into a full SaaS product.
